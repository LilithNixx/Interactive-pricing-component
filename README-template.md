## My process

### Built with

-html
-sass/css
-js

### What I learned

- to make and style a slider using an input type range.
- to style a toggle button.
- to use the event input.

### Continued development

I'm still not happy with the responsive part. when I close the window it moves to the left and I want it to shorten to the middle.
